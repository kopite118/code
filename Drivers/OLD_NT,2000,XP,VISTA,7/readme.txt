These are the old Windows USB CDC drivers.

Starting with CCS C Compiler 5.013, the USB examples started using CCS's own VID.  The Windows drivers were then updated with the new VID/PID combinations.  

Therefore if you need Windows drivers that use the old VID/PID combinations from the USB examples prior to 5.013, they can be found here.
