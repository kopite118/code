////     PIC16F1454/1455/1459                                        ////

////                                                                 ////
//// See the section labeled EXTRA USER FUNCTIONS for functions      ////

//// find useful to use in your application.                         ////
////                                                                 ////
//// This driver lets you use endpoints 0 thru 15.  Endpoint 0 is    ////
//// the setup/control endpoint and is always anabled.               ////
//// You can use any endpoint, but to save RAM it is recommended     ////
//// that you use lower number endpoints and in order.  For example, ////
//// use endpoints 1, 2 and 3 INSTEAD OF using endpoints 1, 8        ////
//// and 15.                                                         ////

////  USB_MAX_EP0_PACKET_LENGTH will be set to 8 regardless          ////
////  of USB speed, to save RAM.                                     ////
////                                                                 ////
////   ************** NOTE ABOUT HW REQUIREMENTS ****************    ////
////  If you are not using internal pullups, you will need to put    ////
////  an internal pullup resistor on D+ or D+ depending on if you    ////
////  want to use slow speed or full speed.  This code configures    ////
////  the device to use internal pullups, see usb_init() if you      ////
////  want to change that.                                           ////
////                                                                 ////
////  You need approximately 470nF cap on Vusb, even if you are      ////
////  using the internal 3.3V USB regulator.                         ////
////                                                                 ////
////  To run at full speed, you must use the oscillator              ////
////  configuration (PLLx) to set the PLL divide to 4MHz.  You can   ////
////  configure the MCU clock to any speed (up to 48MHz) but the     ////
////  PLL must run at 4Mhz to provide the USB peripheral with a      ////
////  96MHz clock.  See the datasheet for details.                   ////
////                                                                 ////
////  To run at slow speed you must configure your MCU to run at     ////
////  24Mhz.  See the datasheet for details.                         ////
////                                                                 ////
////   ****************  NOTE ABOUT INTERRUPTS  ******************   ////

//// PIC when an event has happened on the USB Bus.  Therfore        ////
//// this code enables interrupts.  A user modification can be made  ////
//// to poll the USB interrupt flag instead of relying on an         ////
//// interrupt.                                                      ////
